## 🎯 Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use **ZeroTrace** from the command line:

* Basic Google Dork Search:

Run a Google dork search to find SQL files related to MySQL dumps:

```python
python zerotrace_cli.py -d "filetype:sql \"MySQL dump\" (pass|password|passwd|pwd)" --pages 2 --json results.json --html report.html
```
This command searches for SQL files and exports the results in both JSON and HTML formats.

* AI-Generated Dork Query:

Automatically generate a Google Dork based on a description and retrieve results:

```python
python zerotrace_cli.py -q "Find text files that contain usernames and passwords." --start-page 1 --pages 3 --json output.json --html output.html
```

This command generates a dork based on the input description and retrieves results from the first three pages.

* Download Specific File Types:

Search for and download only PDF and DOC files:
```python
python zerotrace_cli.py -d "filetype:pdf OR filetype:doc \"confidential\"" --download-file-extensions "pdf,doc" --download-folder "my_downloads" --json results.json --html report.html
```
This command searches for both PDF and DOC files containing the term "confidential" and saves them in the "my_downloads" folder.

 * Download All File Types

If you want to download all file types found in the search, you can specify "all":

```python
python zerotrace_cli.py -q "site:example.com" --download-file-extensions "all" --download-folder "downloads" --pages 5 --json output.json --html report.html
```
This command retrieves results from the first five pages for the site "example.com" and downloads all file types into the "downloads" folder.

* Configure API Credentials

If you need to set up or update your API credentials, use the configure flag:

```python
python zerotrace_cli.py --configure
```
This command will guide you through configuring your Google API key and Custom Search Engine ID in the .env file.
